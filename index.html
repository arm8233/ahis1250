					The severity of human-induced climate change is increasingly visible to us. “It is worse, much worse, than you think," writes David Wallace-Wells in his book, <i>The Uninhabitable Earth</i>. Perhaps Wallace-Wells' dire warning isn't so alarmist, after all. Last year, France was beset with wildfires <a class="p1-link" href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/les-decodeurs/article/2022/08/25/fires-in-france-maps-and-graphs-to-visualize-an-unprecedented-summer_5994672_8.html" target="_blank">whose intensity is unprecedented</a>. Unusually intense rainfalls caused floods and bushfires in Australia, <a class="p1-link" href="https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/it-s-official-2022-was-wet-very-wet-20230208-p5ciwd.html" target="_blank">with more unpredictable weather patterns to come in the future</a>. Other parts of the world aren't faring any better. As prospects of a catastrophic climate change loom over us, set to upend our sense of normality in the near-future, we should look into the distant past through archaeology for lessons that can help us face future uncertainties.<br>

					Archaeology is said to be the study of the human past. Whilst that is true, it is as much about the past as it is about the present and the future. When we look at the past, we see that ancient societies are not so different from ours, some in ways that we might not expect. After all, they were people just like us, with aspirations, dreams and fallibilities. They faced many of the same predicaments that we do today, be they pandemics, wars, food scarcity, conflicts or natural disasters, and responded to them in various ways. Disruptions to normal climate patterns further exacerbate these issues; <a class="p1-link" href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/02/forever-changes-climate-lessons-ancient-egypt" target="_blank">this is equally true in our time as it was in the distant past</a>, particularly in ancient Egypt.<span class="sup">1</span><br>

					All things considered, we must acknowledge the limitations of archaeology. We may seem fairly confident about something in the past, but the truth is we may never know with certainty. Our ways of knowing about the past may be informed by modern biases, or we may impose modern interpretations on the past, thereby skewing the reality of what things really were and how they were perceived by ancient societies. This is the limitation of archaeology. As Paul Bahn<span class="sup">11</span> says, everything in archaeology "is tentative, nothing is final".<br>

					What we can learn from studying the past is that we shouldn't underestimate the threats of climate change. We know that climatic disruptions pose stress on issues and can trigger a series of famine, conflicts and wars. In the past, climate and changing environments may have helped bring about the weakening and collapse of ancient polities.<br><br>These threats are equally, perhaps even more, true today. Although <a class="p1-link" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/" target="_blank">the sheer scale of anthropogenic climate change is incomparable to the climatic disruptions that many ancient societies faced</a> the lessons of resilience and adaptation in the face of a threat from these societies can help us face climate change.<br><br>This is why archaeology has never been more important today. Archaeology is a nexus between our time and the past. It uncovers issues common to us and those who came before us, despite its limitations and potential biases, allowing us to learn from their dynamics over long periods of time.<br><br>The path ahead of us seems daunting, but studying how climate change affected ancient societies and how they responded to the challenges of their times, through ingenuity and mistakes alike, can help us understand and face those of our time.<br>
